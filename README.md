# schedule_generator

This repo exists because of a job I had applied for and is a small piece of work to demonstrate skills with being able to stand up a web app quickly.

The aim was to put together the web portion of a staffing schedule generator. This was to provide a schedule given various staffing constraints.

Please note that due to the nature of this code being quickly made over the course of a couple of evenings as a part of a job interview there's not a lot to see here. Contact me if you are interested in a real solution to this problem as it is something I could make fairly easily.
